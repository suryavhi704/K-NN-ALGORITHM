# k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Hands-On Session

## 📌 Overview

This repository showcases my hands-on experience with the **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm**, covering essential aspects such as **data preprocessing, model creation, and evaluation**. Throughout this project, I explored various data science techniques to enhance model accuracy and efficiency.

## 🛠 Skills & Tools Used

- **Scikit-Learn (sklearn)** for implementing the KNN algorithm
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand dataset characteristics
- **Outlier Analysis** for cleaning and refining data
- **Feature Standardization** to improve distance-based calculations

## 🚀 Key Highlights

✔️ **Implemented KNN model** from scratch and using `sklearn`
✔️ **Performed standardization** to optimize distance calculations
✔️ **Analyzed and handled outliers** for better model performance
✔️ **Gained hands-on experience** with supervised learning techniques

## 🎯 Why Standardization?

One of the main attractions of this project was applying **feature standardization** to make calculations easier and improve KNN accuracy. By transforming data into a **standard normal distribution**, distance-based algorithms like KNN yield better results.

## 🔥 Learning Experience

This journey was enriched by expert guidance from **Intellipaat**, which provided valuable insights into **data preprocessing and model optimization**. The session strengthened my understanding of **machine learning fundamentals** and real-world applications of KNN.
